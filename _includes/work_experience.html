    <p><strong>Software & Hardware Development Intern</strong></p>
    <p>Lytehorse Labs | May 2022 - Aug 2022 | Regina, SK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was a single developer in charge of this project. Overall job was to
        develop software to run a custom built dynamometer that company intended
        to use for testing electric ATV.
      </li>
      <li>Primary task #1 was to develop native software using Python.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tools used included TKinter for GUI and multithreading, and TCP socket
          APIs for asynchronous communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using serial, Python signalled Ardunio. Arduino then siganlled
          electric motor controllers on machine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Primary task #2 was to develop logic for Arduino microcontroller in C
        lanaguage. This handlded communcation between user and machine using
        serial protocol.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two-way serial communication meant Arduino accepted input from both
          Python and motor contoroller systems simutaenously.
        </li>
        <li>
          Handled serial input from Python, handled serial input from motor
          controller, and handled sending appropriate serial output responses.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

          along with required operating logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding new pages to CMS for entirelty new functionality, i.e. '/items'
          page.

      <li>Secondary task was to make the CMS mobile-friendly.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After I noticed that many CMS pages were not responsive, I overhauled
          as many pages as possible, making them functionally responsive on
          mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          This positivley impacted staff since many were using the CMS on
          mobile. Many staff members commented positivley.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Additional tasks included monitoring build pipeline for errors, and
        assuring smooth merge of all my pull requests.

    <p>Raven Industries | May 2021 - Aug 2021 | Regina, SK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Overall jobs were to develop new client-side features on ground control
        driving simulator for autonomous vehicle OMNiDRIVE, as well as to
        increase back-end systems test coverage.
      </li>
      <li>Primary task #1 was to create client-side components using React:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating components within the simulator to expand simulator
          functionality
        </li>
        <li>
          Main React task was to add a new expandandle panel, along with the
