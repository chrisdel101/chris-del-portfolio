            <p><strong>Software & Hardware Development Intern</strong></p>
            <p>Lytehorse Labs | May 2022 - Aug 2022 | Regina, SK</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall job was to develop native software for a custom built dynamometer. Dyno was speficiically for testing company electric ATV.</li>
                <li>Primary task #1 was to develop native software using Python, including PY TKinter for GUI.</li>
                <ul>
                <li> Utilized Python multithreading and TCP socket APIs to allow asynchronous communication.</li>
                <li>Using serial, Python signalled Ardunio. Arduino then siganlled electric motor controllers on machine.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Primary task #2 was develop logic for Arduino microcontroller for handling input serial input from Python, handling serial input from motors, and for handling Arduino output.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Arduino code was written in C with Arduino IDE.</li>
                <li>Two-way serial communication meant Arduino accepted input from both Python and motor contoroller systems simutaenously, and sent out approaite signal outputs.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Front End Developement Intern</strong></p>
            <p>54e Dev Studios | Jan 2022 - May 2022 | Regina, SK</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary tasks included developing and testing features withing internal content management system using React and Typescript.</li>
                <li>Development tasks ranged from simple items like adding/removing elements such as buttons, to functionality revamps that required adding and updating page logic.</li>
                <li>Noticing that many CMS pages were not responsive, I overhauled as many as possible, making them functional on mobile. Many staff commented that this fix made their life easier.</li>
                <li>Since my work was being used in production I learned how to use the build pipeline, including indentifying build errors.</li>
