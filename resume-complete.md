            <p><strong>Software & Hardware Development Intern</strong></p>
            <p>Lytehorse Labs | May 2022 - Aug 2022 | Regina, SK</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall job was to develop native software for a custom built dynamometer. Dyno was speficiically for testing company electric ATV.</li>
                <li>Primary task #1 was to develop native software using Python, including PY TKinter for GUI.</li>
                <ul>
                <li> Utilized Python multithreading and TCP socket APIs to allow asynchronous communication.</li>
                <li>Using serial, Python signalled Ardunio. Arduino then siganlled electric motor controllers on machine.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Primary task #2 was develop logic for Arduino microcontroller for handling input serial input from Python, handling serial input from motors, and for handling Arduino output.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Arduino code was written in C with Arduino IDE.</li>
                <li>Two-way serial communication meant Arduino accepted input from both Python and motor contoroller systems simutaenously, and sent out approaite signal outputs.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Overall job was to develop new client-side features for company's internal content managment system using React and Typescript.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adding/removing elements such as buttons, checkboxes, radios, etc., along with required operating logic.</li>
                    <li>Adding new pages to CMS for entirelty new functionality, i.e. '/items' page.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Noticing that many CMS pages were not responsive, I overhauled as many as possible, making them functionally responsive on mobile.</li>   
                    <li>This positivley impacted staff since many were using the CMS on mobile. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Additional tasks included monitoring build pipeline for errors, and assuring smooth merge of all my pull requests.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Overall job was to develop new client-side features for a ground control driving simulator for autonomous vehicle OMNiDRIVE. </li>
                <li>Writing unit tests for internal systems also a major focus of my term.</li>
                <li>Using React, tasks included:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating components within the simulator to expand simulator functionality</li>
                    <li>Main React task was to add a new expandandle panel, along with the connecting logic to make it functional</li>
                    <li>Other smalls task included adding small UI items such as buttons.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                Unit testing for internal systems meant diving into code used for driving autonmous vehicle. I increased the test coverage by 10% by term end.
