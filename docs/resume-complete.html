  <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
  <div class="job-detail">
    <p><strong>Software &amp; Hardware Development Intern</strong></p>
    <p>Lytehorse Labs | May 2022 - Aug 2022 | Regina, SK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was a single developer in charge of this project. Overall job was to
        develop software to run a custom built dynamometer that company intended
        to use for testing electric ATV.
      </li>
      <li>Primary task #1 was to develop native software using Python.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tools used included TKinter for GUI and multithreading, and TCP socket
          APIs for asynchronous communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using serial, Python signalled Ardunio. Arduino then siganlled
          electric motor controllers on machine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Primary task #2 was to develop logic for Arduino microcontroller in C
        lanaguage. This handlded communcation between user and machine using
        serial protocol.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two-way serial communication meant Arduino accepted input from both
          Python and motor contoroller systems simutaenously.
        </li>
        <li>
          Handled serial input from Python, handled serial input from motor
          controller, and handled sending appropriate serial output responses.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Front End Developement Intern</strong></p>
    <p>54e Dev Studios | Jan 2022 - May 2022 | **Regina**, SK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Overall job was to develop new client-side features for company's
        internal content management system using React and Typescript.
      </li>
      <li>
        Primary task was to fulfill supervior assigned tickets, and to assign
        new tickets to tickets myself when required. Tasks included:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adding/removing elements such as buttons, checkboxes, radios, etc.,
          along with required operating logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding new pages to CMS for entirelty new functionality, i.e. '/items'
          page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Secondary task was to make the CMS mobile-friendly.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After I noticed that many CMS pages were not responsive, I overhauled
          as many pages as possible, making them functionally responsive on
          mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          This positivley impacted staff since many were using the CMS on
          mobile. Many staff members commented positivley.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Additional tasks included monitoring build pipeline for errors, and
        assuring smooth merge of all my pull requests.

    <p>Raven Industries | May 2021 - Aug 2021 | Regina, SK</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Overall jobs were to develop new client-side features on ground control
        driving simulator for autonomous vehicle OMNiDRIVE, as well as to
        increase back-end systems test coverage.
      </li>
      <li>Primary task #1 was to create client-side components using React:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating components within the simulator to expand simulator
          functionality
        </li>
        <li>
          Main React task was to add a new expandandle panel, along with the
          connecting logic to make it operational.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other smalls task included adding small UI items such as buttons.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Primary task #2 was to write unit tests for back-end vehicle systems
        using Python:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unit testing for internal systems meant deep-diving into code used for
          driving an autonmous vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was able to increase the test coverage by 10% by the end of term.
